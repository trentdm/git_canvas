git_canvas
=======
Uses text input to periodically make git contributions, generating a canvas of your text input over time.

ToDo
-------
This thing has a long ways to go.
Investigate http://aheckmann.github.io/gm/docs.html as a means to draw text, and downsize text to correct size/depth. Then read out bytes to get canvas.
